    "# Estimating a Bicycle Wheel's Radial Inertia\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the relationship of vibrational motion to the inertia of a system and how one might estimate the inertia given measured vibrational data. The determination of the radial and axial moments of inertia of a bicycle wheel are used as a motivating example.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the completion of this assignment students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- import measurement data into Python\n",
    "- visualize the vibrational measurements\n",
    "- use interactive plots to cause a simulation to match measurements\n",
    "- understand the concept of natural frequency and its relationship to mass/inertia and stiffness\n",
    "- state two of the three fundamental characteristics that govern vibration (mass/inertia and stiffness)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inertia and Vibration\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental properties that affects how systems vibrate is the inertia of a system. Inertia is colloquially defined as the *tendency to do nothing or to remain unchanged*. A vibrating system is changing with respect to time, thus we may infer that inertia will try to prevent the system from changing. There are two specific types of inertia that we will address in this class: [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass) which is a resistance to linear motion and [moment of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia) which is a resistenace to rotational motion. The moment of inertia is more specifically a descriptor for the distribution of mass in a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people are familiar with an ordinary bicycle wheel, so we will look into the inertial characteristics of bicycle wheels and how this relates to vibration. A bicycle wheel is mostly symetric about a plane that passes through the cross sectional center line of the circular rim in addition to being symmetric about any radial plane normal to the wheel plane. Recalling from dynamics, this means that the moment of inertia will have three [prinicipal moments of inertia](http://www.physics.arizona.edu/~varnes/Teaching/321Fall2004/Notes/Lecture34.pdf), two of which are equal due to the nature of the symmetry. The inertia about the axle of the wheel is the rotational inertia (resists the wheel rolling) and the inertia about any radial axis resists motions like turning the handlebars, etc. We demonstrated in the previous lesson that the inertia of the book affected the period of oscillation, and thus if a bicycle wheel is vibrated its inertia should affect the vibration in some way also.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Torsional Pendulum\n",
    "\n",
    "Vibrations of a mass or inertia occur when there is a force that acts on the system which displaces it from its equilibrium. A common way to measure inertia is to use a torsional spring with a known linear force/displacement ratio, the spring constant or stiffness, to resist motion and thus create this force. If we attach a torsional spring along a radial line of the bicycle wheel, through its center of mass and glue the other end to the ceiling it is possible to create a *torsional pendulum*. If you twist the wheel about the axis of the torsional spring it will start vibrating.\n",
    "\n",
    "The video belows shows such a setup. A bicycle wheel is attached to the ceiling by a slender steel rod. The rod's axis passes through the center of mass of the wheel. When the bicycle wheel is given an initial angular displacement from the equilibrium and then released, it vibrates."

The faster it rotates the more force is applied to slow it down. This will cause more damping in the simulation the higher the value is. It is a resonable representation of the damping from air resistance on the wheel. Make an interactive plot like you did above with two adjustable constants: `torsional_damping` and `rotational_inertia`. Adjust the parameters until the simulation matches.
